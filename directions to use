Details:-

1. This programe is written in linux and in c language
2. As C is platform dependant this works fine in ubuntu
3. you must provide a relative path to the file to be encrypted from the directory of execution
4. the encrypted.txt file is maintained with list of files encrypted.
5. the code.txt file has values for each character and If you change the values encryption will be altered
6. change code.txt only after decripting your encripted files otherwise data will be lost
7. Both code.txt and encrypted.txt must be present in the directory of execution
8. Never change encrypted.txt

How to execute:- 

1. open terminal ----------------->  ctrl+t
2. navigate to the directory which has "crypt" file(executable) ----------> cd path/of/directory
3. execute the file as follows -----------> ./crypt fileName
	where fileName is path of file to be encripted or decripted
	Don't worry about choosing between encript or decript the encrypted.txt is maintained to ease your work and it will take care of choosing.
